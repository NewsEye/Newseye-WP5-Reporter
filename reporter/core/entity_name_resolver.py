    A NLGPipelineComponent that transforms abstracted entity identifers to names.

    Entity name variants are supplied as the 'ner_table' component in the registry.

    When an entity is first encountered, "full_name" is used. On subsequent uses,
    either "short_name" or "pronoun" is used depending on whether the previously
    encountered entity is the same entity as the one being processed.

    # We want certain entity_types to be "possible confusable" for each other. For example
    # it is possible for a reader to get confused with a pronoun like "they" if the previous
    # sentence discusses both a party and a candidate. At the same time, there are cases where
    # such confusion is not in pratice possible, for example when we refer to "they" in a sentence
    # that has only discussed a single party and some location.
    #
    # Thus, we define a data structure where
    # these "confusion-groups" each map to a key. This allows us to in turn key the previous_entities
    # my by confusion-group, rather than by entity_type.
    #
    # This solution is likely going to turn out to be language-specific. If so, some abstraction is
    # needed or the confusion-groups must be keyed by language as well.
    #
    # In this implementation, it is enough to define the multi-entity_type confusion groups, as we
    # can simply use the default parameter in dict.get() to return the key for other cases-
